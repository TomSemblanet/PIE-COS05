Welcome to Debris Removal Tool's documentation!
===============================================

**Debris Removal Tool** (DRT) is a sample of python codes aiming to plan debris removal missions (consisting in multiple space rendezvous). For a given set of debris, DRT plans several missions, each one including 4 to 5 debris (by default). 

It is focused on two major axes which are :

- the regroupement of the debris in order to plan optimal missions

- the plannification of the multiple rendezvous missions
